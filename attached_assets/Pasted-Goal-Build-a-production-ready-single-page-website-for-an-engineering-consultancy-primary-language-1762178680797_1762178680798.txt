Goal: Build a production-ready, single-page website for an engineering consultancy (primary language: Arabic, RTL), with a portfolio gallery, contact form, email/phone capture modal, a customer database for signups, and automatic welcome emails upon registration.

Content & Sections (on one page):

Hero header with company name/logo, short tagline, primary CTA button “تواصل معنا”.

About the Company: short description.

Vision and Mission (separate sub-sections).

Principles/Values (bullet list).

Portfolio Gallery: grid of project cards (image, title, short description); clicking opens a lightbox/carousel.

Contact Section:

Contact form fields: Full Name, Email, Phone, Message.

Submit button: “إرسال”.

Secondary CTA button “تواصل عبر واتساب” (opens WhatsApp link with prefilled message).

Footer: company address, email, phone, social links.

Signup Modal (appears on first visit and via a “اشترك” button):

Fields: Email (required), Phone (required), Consent checkbox (“I agree to receive emails and messages”).

On submit:

Save to database.

Send an automatic welcome email in Arabic.

Show success toast/confirmation.

Data & Emails:

Database tables (minimum):

subscribers(id, email UNIQUE, phone, consent BOOLEAN, created_at TIMESTAMP, source_page, ip_address)

projects(id, title, description, image_url, category, created_at)

messages(id, full_name, email, phone, message, created_at, status)

Email sending: transactional welcome email on signup (Arabic template). Use environment-based API keys. Include simple text + HTML.

Functional Requirements:

Arabic as default language, RTL layout; support English as optional secondary language.

Responsive (mobile-first), fast load (<2.5s on 4G), accessible (basic WCAG AA).

Form validation (client + server), spam protection (honeypot + rate limiting).

SEO basics: meta tags, OG/Twitter tags, sitemap.xml, robots.txt.

Analytics: basic page view + form conversion tracking.

Security: server-side validation, parameterized queries/ORM, no secrets in client.

Privacy: consent text, unsubscribe instructions in email, store timestamp of consent.

Tech (you may adjust if needed):

Frontend: modern framework with RTL support.

Styling: utility CSS.

Backend: API routes for forms + signup.

Database: SQL (e.g., Postgres) with migrations.

Email: reputable transactional service (e.g., SendGrid/Mailgun).

Deployment: cloud host with SSL and environment variables.

Acceptance Criteria:

Single page renders correctly in Arabic (RTL) on Chrome/Safari/Firefox (mobile + desktop).

Portfolio grid with lightbox works and is CMS-like (add/edit via JSON/seed/migrations).

Contact form writes to messages and sends confirmation email to the company inbox.

Signup modal writes to subscribers and triggers welcome email.

Export CSV endpoints or admin page for subscribers and messages.

Lighthouse: Performance ≥ 85, Accessibility ≥ 90, SEO ≥ 90 on mobile.

Clear .env.example with required keys.

README with setup, run, deploy instructions.

Nice to Have (optional):

WhatsApp deep link prefilled: “مرحبا، أود الاستفسار عن خدماتكم.”

Image optimization and lazy loading in portfolio.

ReCAPTCHA v3 or hCaptcha (behind a feature flag).

Deliverables:

Source code repository.

Database migration files and seed script for projects.

Email template (HTML + plain text).

Deployed URL with SSL and working forms/emails.

Admin/export access (protected route or CLI command) to download CSVs.
